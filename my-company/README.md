# my-company

A simple four-page React website scaffolded with Vite.

Pages:
- Home
- About
- Services
- Contact (with a simple form)

How to run (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd 'c:\Users\kr14r\OneDrive\Desktop\React_vite\my-company'
npm install
npm run dev
```

If you hit PowerShell script execution policy errors when running npm, run this once in an elevated PowerShell:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

This project uses react-router-dom for routing. Components use inline styling for simplicity.
